## Prompt

add my linkedin link to the footer by my name and same for my github link.

## Response

Updated the Docusaurus configuration to add both LinkedIn and GitHub links to the footer as requested:

1. Added LinkedIn link: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanwal-shahzadi` to the Connect section in the footer
2. Maintained the existing GitHub link in the same Connect section
3. Both links now appear under the "Connect" section in the footer

The changes were made in `docusaurus.config.js`:
- Modified the footer links structure in the Connect section to include both GitHub and LinkedIn links
- The links appear in the order: GitHub first, then LinkedIn
