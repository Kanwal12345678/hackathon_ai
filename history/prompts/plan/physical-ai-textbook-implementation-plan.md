# Physical AI Textbook Implementation Plan

## Summary
Created the implementation plan for the Physical AI — AI-Native Textbook, which includes 8 chapters with 5 lessons each (40 lessons total) in Docusaurus-compatible Markdown format. The plan ensures all content follows the Physical AI constitution principles of specification-first thinking, hands-on simulation-first learning, AI as co-creator, progressive skill building, and practical system design.

## Prompt
```
1. Generate the **full Docusaurus file structure** for the book:
   - 8 chapters, 5 lessons each
   - Each lesson as a separate Markdown file
   for RAG
   - Use clear, simple language
   - Do not include content outside scope

Confirmation Step:
- Summarize how you will generate the **chapter outline and lesson files** before starting
```

## Response
Successfully created the complete implementation plan for the Physical AI textbook with:

- **Technical Context**: Defined the project scope, technology stack, and constraints
- **Constitution Check**: Verified alignment with Physical AI principles
- **Research Document**: Outlined decisions and alternatives for key implementation choices
- **Data Model**: Created entity relationships for textbook structure
- **Quickstart Guide**: Provided instructions for working with the textbook content
