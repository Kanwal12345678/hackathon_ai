# Textbook Chapters Spec Generation

## Summary
Created comprehensive specification for the Textbook Chapters section feature, detailing UI structure, design requirements, functional requirements, and success criteria. The specification covers the main heading with gradient text, sub-heading, responsive grid of 8 chapter cards with glassmorphism design, and all required content elements.

## Prompt
```
You are a senior UI/UX designer and frontend engineer.

I want to build a "Textbook Chapters" section for an Physical AI & AI Native website.

UI Structure (very important):
1. Main heading at top center:
   "Textbook Chapters"
   - Large, bold
   - Pink → Purple gradient text
   - Subtle glow effect

2. Sub-heading under the main heading:
   "8 comprehensive modules covering Physical AI & AI Native"
   - Smaller text
   - Light muted color
   - Clean spacing

3. Below this, create a responsive grid of 8 chapter cards.

Each chapter card design:
- Dark glassmorphism style card
- Rounded corners
- Subtle gradient border (pink / purple / blue variation)
- Soft glow on hover
- Clean modern look

Each card must include:
- Small icon at top (emoji or lucide icon)
- Chapter title (bold)
- Short description (2–3 lines max)
- "Read Chapter →" button at bottom


Use EXACT chapter names below:

1. Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
2. Chapter 2: Specification-Driven Design
3. Chapter 3: Simulation Environments
4. Chapter 4: AI Agent Collaboration
5. Chapter 5: Basic Movement and Control
6. Chapter 6: Sensor Integration and Perception
7. Chapter 7: Advanced Physical AI Systems
8. Chapter 8: Deployment and Real-World Applications

Design & theme:
- Dark background
- Pink & purple accent colors
- Futuristic AI / robotics feel
- Premium textbook-style UI

Technical requirements:
- React (Docusaurus compatible)
- Tailwind CSS
- Fully responsive (desktop + mobile)
- Clean semantic JSX
- Hover animations
- No paid assets

Please:
- Build the complete
```

## Response
Successfully created a comprehensive specification document for the Textbook Chapters section feature with:
