## Learning Objectives
- Install and configure essential tools for Physical AI development
- Set up simulation environments for Physical AI experimentation
- Integrate AI agent tools into your development workflow
- Validate your development environment with basic tests

## Overview
A proper development environment is essential for effective Physical AI work. This lesson guides you through setting up the tools, libraries, and platforms needed for simulation-first Physical AI development, with emphasis on AI agent collaboration.

## Theory
A Physical AI development environment typically includes:

**Simulation Platforms**: Physics engines and simulation environments that provide realistic physical interactions. Popular options include PyBullet, MuJoCo, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac Gym.

**Programming Frameworks**: Libraries and frameworks for implementing AI algorithms and control systems, such as Python with NumPy/SciPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and robotics-specific libraries.

**AI Agent Integration**: Tools and interfaces for working with AI agents, including APIs, development environments, and collaboration platforms.

**Visualization and Debugging Tools**: Systems for visualizing simulation results, debugging physical interactions, and analyzing system behavior.

**Version Control and Documentation**: Systems for managing code, simulation configurations, and experiment results.

## Hands-On / Exercise
Follow these steps to set up your Physical AI development environment:

1. Install Python 3.8+ and essential libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)

2. Choose and install a simulation platform (e.g., PyBullet):
   ```
   pip install pybullet
   ```

3. Set up your AI agent collaboration environment (e.g., VS Code with AI extensions)

4. Create a basic simulation environment with a simple physical object

5. Write a simple script to control the object's movement

6. Test your setup by running a basic physics simulation

7. Integrate your AI agent by asking it to help improve your basic simulation

8. Create a simple "Hello Physical AI" project that demonstrates basic interaction

9. Document your setup process and any challenges encountered

10. Validate your environment by completing a simple task with AI agent assistance
