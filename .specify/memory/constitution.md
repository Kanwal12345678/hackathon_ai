# Physical AI — AI-Native Textbook Constitution

## Vision
Teach beginners-to-intermediate learners to design, simulate, and deploy Physical AI systems using AI agents, with a hands-on, simulation-first, specification-driven approach.

## Core Principles

### 1. Specification-First Thinking
All learning activities and system designs must begin with clear, detailed specifications before implementation. This ensures learners develop systematic thinking patterns essential for building robust Physical AI systems. Rationale: Specification-first methodology reduces errors, improves communication, and creates transferable skills applicable to real-world AI development workflows.

### 2. Hands-On, Simulation-First Learning
Learning experiences must prioritize practical, hands-on exercises that leverage simulation environments before any hardware deployment. Rationale: Simulation-first approach makes Physical AI education accessible to all learners regardless of hardware availability while providing safe, repeatable learning environments.

### 3. AI as a Co-Creator
AI agents must be positioned as collaborative partners in the learning and creation process, not just tools. Learners should understand how to work synergistically with AI systems. Rationale: Modern Physical AI development requires fluency in human-AI collaboration, making this partnership a foundational skill for practitioners.

### 4. Progressive Skill Building
Content must be structured to build skills progressively, with each concept reinforcing and expanding upon previous learning. Rationale: Progressive skill building ensures learners develop solid foundations before tackling advanced concepts, improving retention and practical application ability.

### 5. Practical System Design
All theoretical concepts must connect directly to practical system design principles that learners can apply to real-world problems. Rationale: Bridging theory and practice ensures learners acquire transferable skills relevant to industry applications and research.
