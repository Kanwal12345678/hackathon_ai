# Tasks: Physical AI — AI-Native Textbook

## Implementation Strategy

MVP Scope: Complete Chapter 1 with all 5 lessons to validate the Docusaurus structure and content format.
Incremental Delivery: Complete chapters sequentially, with each chapter being independently testable.

## Dependencies

- User Stories are independent where possible
- Foundational setup must be completed before content creation
- Chapter N must be completed before Chapter N+1 for progressive learning

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Lesson creation within different chapters can be parallelized after foundational setup
- Different authors can work on different chapters simultaneously
- Docusaurus configuration and content creation can proceed in parallel
