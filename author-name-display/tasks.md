# Tasks: Author Name Display Implementation

## Implementation Strategy

MVP Scope: Add author attribution "By Kanwal Shahzadi" below the main heading with subtle styling.
Incremental Delivery: Implement component modification and styling in one phase.

## Dependencies

- The main heading element "Physical AI — AI-Native Textbook" must exist in the DOM
- HomepageHeader component must be accessible for modification
- CSS file must be accessible for styling additions

## Parallel Execution Examples

- None for this implementation - all tasks must be completed sequentially
