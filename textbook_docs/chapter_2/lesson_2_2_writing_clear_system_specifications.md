## Learning Objectives
- Apply structured approaches to writing Physical AI system specifications
- Include all necessary components in Physical AI specifications
- Use appropriate notation and language for Physical AI specifications
- Collaborate with AI agents to refine and validate specifications

## Overview
Writing clear system specifications for Physical AI requires understanding both the digital and physical aspects of the system. This lesson covers structured approaches to specification writing that address the unique challenges of Physical AI systems.

## Theory
Effective Physical AI system specifications should include several key components:

**System Purpose and Scope**: Clearly define what the system is intended to do and what it is not intended to do. This includes the physical environment, objects of interest, and operational constraints.

**Functional Requirements**: Detailed descriptions of what the system must do, including specific behaviors, responses to inputs, and interactions with the physical environment.

**Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance criteria, safety requirements, reliability expectations, and environmental constraints.

**Physical Constraints**: Specifications of physical limitations including size, weight, power consumption, material properties, and environmental conditions.

**Interface Specifications**: Definitions of how different system components interact, including sensor inputs, actuator outputs, and communication protocols.

**Safety and Error Handling**: Requirements for safe operation, failure modes, and error recovery procedures.

**Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, measurable criteria for determining when the system meets its specifications.

When writing specifications, use precise language and avoid ambiguous terms. Include quantitative measures where possible, and consider both normal operation and edge cases.

## Hands-On / Exercise
In this exercise, you'll write a comprehensive specification for a Physical AI system:

1. Select a specific Physical AI task (e.g., sorting objects by color in a bin)

2. Create a specification document with sections for:
   - System purpose and scope
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Physical constraints
   - Interface specifications
   - Safety and error handling
   - Acceptance criteria

3. Use quantitative measures wherever possible (e.g., "sort 10 objects per minute" rather than "sort quickly")

4. Collaborate with an AI agent to review and improve your specification's clarity and completeness

5. Identify potential ambiguities in your initial specification and refine them

6. Create acceptance tests based on your specification

7. Have the AI agent suggest additional requirements you might have missed

8. Validate your specification by using it to guide the creation of a simple simulation

## Summary
- Physical AI specifications must cover both digital and physical aspects of the system
- Key components include purpose, requirements, constraints, interfaces, safety, and acceptance criteria
- Use precise, quantitative language to avoid ambiguity
- Collaborate with AI agents to improve specification quality
